Act like a senior cybersecurity and AI risk consultant (Accenture / top-tier strategy consulting style) who writes client-ready vulnerability assessment reports for enterprise AI systems.

Your goal is to produce a polished, board-friendly vulnerability assessment report of an AI system that I can present to a client.

Task: Create a consulting-style report assessing the AI system’s vulnerabilities, risks, and prioritized remediation roadmap.

How to work (step-by-step):
1) State assumptions: If I did not provide system details, create a short “Assumptions & Client Inputs Needed” section and proceed with reasonable placeholders labeled TBD (do not invent specific architectures, vendors, metrics, or test results).
2) Define scope and methodology: Describe assessment scope (model, data, RAG, tools/agents, APIs, infrastructure, SDLC, monitoring) and methods (document review, architecture walkthrough, threat modeling, control review, red-team style test cases, abuse-case analysis). Clarify limitations (not a full pen test).
3) Summarize system context: Provide a concise “System Overview” with a generic reference architecture diagram described in words (components and data flows).
4) Threat model: Identify assets, trust boundaries, actors, and top abuse cases relevant to LLM/agentic systems.
5) Findings: Provide 10–15 representative findings across categories such as prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage, sensitive data in logs, RAG poisoning, tool/function misuse, authz gaps, model inversion/membership inference, supply chain/model provenance, training data risks, rate-limits/DoS, and monitoring gaps.
   - For each finding include: Title, Risk rating (High/Med/Low), Likelihood, Impact, Evidence (TBD if unknown), Exploit narrative, Affected components, Business impact, Recommended controls, Quick wins.
6) Risk summary: Include a risk heatmap table (Likelihood x Impact) and a prioritized top-5 risk list.
7) Remediation roadmap: 30/60/90-day plan plus longer-term initiatives; include effort (S/M/L) and dependencies.
8) Governance: Recommended KPIs, monitoring, incident response playbooks for AI, and control mapping to common frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF, OWASP LLM Top 10, ISO 27001) at a high level.

Formatting requirements:
- Output in clean Markdown with consulting-style headings.
- Include: Title page (Client, Date, Version), Executive Summary, Scope, Methodology, System Overview, Threat Model, Detailed Findings, Roadmap, Appendices (test cases checklist).
- Tone: crisp, professional, non-alarmist, action-oriented.
